# Promotions

This repository is part of the NYU class **CSCI-GA.2810-001: DevOps and Agile Methodologies** taught by John Rofrano, Adjunct Instructor, NYU Curant Institute, Graduate Division, Computer Science. It contains the work done by the promotions squad for this class in fall of 2020.

## Overview

This is the repository that houses the code to implement promotions on an eCommerce shop.

The project contains the following:

```text
.gitignore          - this will ignore vagrant and other metadata files
requirements.txt    - list if Python libraries required by your code
Vagrantfile         - Vagrant file that installs Python 3
app.py              - a Python file that builds a Flask application that simply returns "Hello World"
```

## Building Locally

### Vagrant

You will need to download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Then clone this repository to your computer, and invoke vagrant:

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:2020-nyu-devops/promotions.git
    cd promotions
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
```

To run the service use `flask run` (Press Ctrl+C to exit):

```bash
  $ FLASK_APP=service:app flask run -h 0.0.0.0
```

You must pass the parameters `-h 0.0.0.0` to have it listed on all network adapters to that the post can be forwarded by `vagrant` to your host computer so that you can open the web page in a local browser at: http://localhost:5000. When you are done, you should exit the virtual machine and shut down the vm with:

```bash
 $ exit
 $ vagrant halt
```

If the VM is no longer needed you can remove it with:

```bash
  $ vagrant destroy
```

### Manual install using local Python

If you have Python 3 installed on your computer you can make a virtual environment and run the code locally with:

```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    FLASK_APP=app flask run
```

## Manually running the Tests

Run the tests using `nose`

```shell
    $ nosetests
```

Nose is configured via the included `setup.cfg` file to automatically include the flags `--with-spec --spec-color` so that red-green-refactor is meaningful. If you are in a command shell that supports colors, passing tests will be green while failing tests will be red.

Nose is also configured to automatically run the `coverage` tool and you should see a percentage of coverage report at the end of your tests. If you want to see what lines of code were not tested use:

```shell
    $ coverage report -m
```

This is particularly useful because it reports the line numbers for the code that is not covered so that you can write more test cases to get higher code coverage.

You can also manually run `nosetests` with `coverage` (but `setup.cfg` does this already)

```shell
    $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=service
```

Try and get as close to 100% coverage as you can.

## Endpoints
